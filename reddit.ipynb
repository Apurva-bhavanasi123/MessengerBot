            "Guy absolutely loved being in Cincy and definitely played hard. Whoever picks him up may be happy if he's signed for cheap. Has a lot of PI's and gets burned semi-regularly. Not my favorite Bengal to watch but, you can't say he didn't care for whatever that's worth.\n",

            "Dre Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked.\n",
            "Damn. I‚Äôm really going to miss seeing him get burnt play after play, and celebrating when the QB overthrows the guy like he was the one who did something. Had such high hopes for him. Maybe a change of scenery is all that‚Äôs needed\n",
            "With the team for 8 years as a reasonably good starter. Never a world beater, but solid. You can ask for more for a first rounder, but its hard to call him a bust. Hope the best for him.\n",
            "He got hurt right? So he'll come cheap plus he played for Zimmer and knows the scheme...Rick please!\n",
            "Come\n",
            "To Dallas. If I‚Äôm not mistaken I think dix and Kirkpatrick already played together we bama . Unsure of the years they were each there\n",

            "I have a weird semi-soft spot for Dre because he came out of college the year I really started watching the Combine obsessively. I did so because Trumaine Johnson was coming out of Montana and I really wanted to track his path to the draft but it planted this seed that leads to me doing like several mock drafts a day in 2020.\n",
            "\n",
            "I expect to see the Raiders rumored to be interested in Dre with Pauly G as DC still and the gaping hole at CB. He would definitely have to come cheap, though. We have plenty of little contracts we can get rid of to make room but I'm not sure who he would take priority over.\n",
            "Honestly this really sucks on a personal level because he loved Cincinnati and the team. But effort and passion for success can only take you so far in the NFL. He was an extremely inconsistent player at best, downright bad at his worst. His only consistency was in getting burned on poor reads, and giving up pass interference penalties. He wasn‚Äôt a good player for us.\n",

            "He has severe issues with defensive discipline and was a major liability to our defense. His desire to lead and his dedication to the team were appreciated but ultimately nowhere close to enough for us to be competent defensively. I could see him succeeding in a place like New England where discipline is extreme, but we never would‚Äôve been able to make him a successful player.\n",

            "\n",
            "Teams couldn't target him because he's not a bad corner, he would just get a penalty at some really bad times. I can accept that to a degree. He's about 90% of a Josh Norman... that's probably the best comparison I can come up with.\n",
